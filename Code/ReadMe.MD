### Introduction

This folder contains replication code for "Estimation and Inference about Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
in High-Dimensional Dynamic Panels" by Vira Semenova, Matt Goldman, Victor Chernozhukov, Matt Taddy.

To replicate Figure 2: "Average price elasticity for Level 2 categories: estimate and 95% condence
bands", run 
```Figure_Level2.R```

To replicate Figure 3: "Histogram of estimated price elasticities for each category in Dairy products", run 
```Figure_Histograms.R```

To replicate Figure 4: "Average price elasticity for Level 2 categories: estimate and 95% confidence bands,
by month", 
```Figure_Months.R```
